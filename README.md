-- Lame Programs and Stuff

XWcF14.png -- Original graphics file.

XWcF14.c -- Lame C program that builds into the XWcF14 Linux program to convert the GIMP-created C array into the ASCII version of text letters representing pixels.

XWcF14 -- Lame Linux executable program that outputs the GIM-created C array as a more manageable ASCII file of letters representing pixel values.

XWcF14.asc -- ASCII text version of the screen graphics.  This is output by the XWcF14 Linux executable program.

XWcF14.BXL -- Lame OSS BASIC XL program (SAVE'd, tokenized version) that reads the text output from the XWcF14 program, plots the data in graphics mode 7, and then creates the binary executable file XWcF14.xex that can be run from DOS (48K mem or more)

XWcF14.LXL -- LIST'd version, in ATASCII format, of the Lame XWcF14.BXL BASIC XL program 

XWcF14.TXL -- LIST'd version, in regular ASCII (normal line feeds) of the Lame XWcF14.BXL BASIC XL program.

XWcF14.xex -- Lame Atari executable program that loads the display list, screen memory, color registers, and then waits.  This is created by the lame BASIC XL program.

XWcF14_160x96.png -- The graphics file resized to 160x96 to fit the Atari Graphics Mode 7 screen resolution.

XWcF14_ATARI800_640.png -- Screen grab from the Atari800 emulator running the XWcF14.xex program.
